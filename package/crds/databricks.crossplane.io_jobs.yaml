                      to never retry. The default behavior is to never retry. A run
                      can have the following lifecycle state: PENDING, RUNNING, TERMINATING,
                      TERMINATED, SKIPPED or INTERNAL_ERROR.'

                                        restart the cluster if it stops responding.
                                        We strongly suggest to use new_cluster for
                                        greater reliability.

                                              the run is initiated by a call to run-now
                                              with parameters specified, the two parameters
                                              maps will be merged. If the same key
                                              is specified in base_parameters and
                                              in run-now, the value from run-now will
                                              be used. If the notebook takes a parameter
                                              that is not specified in the job’s base_parameters
                                              or the run-now override parameters,

                                              will be used. Retrieve these parameters
                                              in a notebook using dbutils.widgets.get.
